        have "You're working hard today.' "Yes, I've lived there all their lives. got a lot to do.' John isn't lazy. He works very hard most of the
        time. See Unit 1 for more information. See Unit 2 for more information. always do and I'm always doing Usually we say 'I always do something'
        (= I do it every time): O I always go to work by car. (not 'I'm always going') You can also say I'm always doing something, but this has a
        different meaning. For example: I've lost my key again. I'm always losing things. 'I'm always losing things' does not mean that I lose things
        every time. It means that I lose things too often, more often than normal. 'You're always -ing' means that you do something very often, more
        often than the speaker thinks is normal or reasonable. You're always watching television. You should do something more active. John is never

        NIT Present continuous and present simple (2) (I am doing and I do) We use continuous tenses only for actions and happenings (they are eating
        / it is raining etc.). Some verbs (for example, know and like) are not action verbs. You cannot say I am knowing' or they are liking'; you can
        only say 'I know', "they like'. The following verbs are not normally used in continuous tenses: like love hate want need prefer know realise
        suppose mean understand believe remember belong contain consist depend seem 9 I'm I hungry. I want something to eat. (not 'I'm wanting') 0 Do
        you understand what mean? Ann doesn't seem very happy at the moment. When think means 'believe', do not use the continuous: What do you think
        (= believe) will happen? (not 'what are you thinking') but © You look serious. What are you thinking about? = What is going (non in your
        mind?) 0 I'm thinking of giving up my job. (= am considering) When have means 'possess' etc., do not use the continuous (see Unit 17): We're
        enjoying our holiday. We have a nice room in the hotel. (not 'we're having') but D We're enjoying our holiday. We're having a great time. B
        See hear smell taste We normally use the present simple (not continuous) with these verbs: e Do you see that man over there? (not 'are you
        seeing') This room smells. Let's open a window. We often use can + see/hear/smell/taste: • Listen! Can you hear something? But you can use the
        continuous with see (I'm seeing) when the meaning is 'having a meeting with (especially in the future - see Unit 19A): 6 I'm seeing the
        manager tomorrow morning. C He is selfish and He is being selfish The present continuous of be is I am being / he is being you are being etc.
        I'm being = 'I'm behaving / I'm acting'. Compare: d can't understand why he's being so selfish. He isn't usually like that. (being selfish =
        behaving selfishly at the moment) but ® He never thinks about other people. He is very selfish. (not 'he is being') (= he is selfish
        generally, not only at the moment) We use am/is/are being to say how somebody is behaving. It is not usually possible in other sentences: @
        It's hot today. (not 'it is being hot') Sarah is very tired. (not 'is being tired') D Look and feel You can use the present simple or
        continuous when you say how somebody looks or feels now: • You look well today. or You're looking well today. How do you feel now? or How are
        you feeling now?
